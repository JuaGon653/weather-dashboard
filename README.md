# weather-dashboard

## Description

For the 6th challenge assignment in the coding bootcamp, I was requested to make an application that acts basically as any other weather app. Such as, displaying selected data of the current weather and next 5 forecasted days. But in order to get this data I have to use 2 different APIs. [GeocodingAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api), to get the coordinates of the inputted city and [OneCallAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api), to get the weather data based off the coordinates received from the Geocoding API. Lastly, for a better user experience, a history list of last searched cities is displayed below the search bar.
